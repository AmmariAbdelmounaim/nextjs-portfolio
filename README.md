## Getting Started

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update this file with your credentials:

```plaintext
# GOOGLE ANALYTICS
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=your_google_analytics_key

# EMAILJS Service
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_emailjs_service_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_emailjs_template_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_emailjs_public_key
```

You can follow this tutorial part to get emailjs creds : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkowOdMjvYo&t=6254s

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
